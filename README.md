LinkedIn Assistant – Before & After Evaluation

This repository documents the evaluation of my LinkedIn Assistant final project, where I transformed CV credentials into high-impact LinkedIn profile content using an agentic AI workflow.

The repo provides evidence of partially optimized vs. optimized outputs evaluated through VMock, as well as a sample of the agent–user interaction.

Files and their descriptions: 

1) Example_of_improvement-Before
Screenshot of my LinkedIn profile evaluation when developing the workflow. The profile shows amber ratings in the "Content" category , highlighting key weaknesses of the non-agentic process.

2) Example-Improvement_with_AI_Agent
Screenshot of my LinkedIn profile evaluation after optimization with the agentic workflow. The updated profile shows all categories rated green, reflecting a fully optimized LinkedIn presence.

3) Sample_chat
Excerpt of a chat with the AI agent, showing how it was configured, refined, and guided to generate LinkedIn section content. This illustrates the iterative, collaborative workflow used to achieve the improved outputs.
